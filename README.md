# NGif SkiaSharp
.NET advanced GIF library

This repo is a fork of [avianbc/NGif](https://github.com/avianbc/NGif), which is a fork of NGif-Animated-GIF-Encoder-for-NET by gOODiDEA.NET.

The change is to use SkiaSharp instead of System.Drawing and to target .NET Standard 2.0 which allows it to be cross platform.
